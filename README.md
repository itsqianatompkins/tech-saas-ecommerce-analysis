# SaaS Business Impact: A Cross-Functional Analysis in Gaming Commerce 

# Background 

GameGalaxy, a gaming retailer, operates across web, mobile, and console platforms using SaaS technology and has experienced rapid growth in customer base, sales, and operations. However, leadership lacks a unified understanding of sales trends, customer value, product performance, and logistics efficiency across different markets and channels. With increasing competition and rising operational costs, the company needs clear, data-driven visibility into which products drive revenue, which channels attract high-value users, and where operational bottlenecks are slowing fulfillment and eroding customer loyalty. The data provided offers an opportunity to uncover these insights and address existing blind spots.

# Overview

  - Which countries, platforms, and customer segments offer the strongest opportunities for growth

These insights will allow GameGalaxy to optimize pricing and product strategy, allocate marketing spend more efficiently, improve logistics performance, and strengthen revenue through targeted customer strategies.
